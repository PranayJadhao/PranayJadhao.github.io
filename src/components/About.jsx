        I am currently doing my BE in mechanical engineering from datta meghe college of engineering and reserch wardha. But later on I got interset in website development and coading that's why I joined Masai school which offers a 30 weeks full time course on a full stack web development programme. At Masai school we get hands-on experience to learn front end and backend technologies. 
 I love to make projects which are helpful for masses and serve as a great helpful entity.
